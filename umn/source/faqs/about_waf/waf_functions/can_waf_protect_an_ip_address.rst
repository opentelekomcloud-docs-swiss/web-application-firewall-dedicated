Can WAF Protect an IP Address?
==============================

A WAF instance can protect IP addresses.

Dedicated Mode
--------------

A dedicated or load balancing WAF instance can protect websites through either domain names or IP addresses.

The origin server IP address configured in WAF can be a public IP address or internal IP address.
