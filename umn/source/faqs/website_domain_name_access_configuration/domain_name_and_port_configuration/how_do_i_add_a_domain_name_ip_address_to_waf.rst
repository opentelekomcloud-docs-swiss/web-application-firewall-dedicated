How Do I Add a Domain Name/IP Address to WAF?
=============================================

After you connect a domain name or IP address of the website you want to protect to WAF, WAF works as a reverse proxy between the client and the server. The real IP address of the server is hidden and only the IP address of WAF is visible to web visitors. For details, see :ref:`Step 1: Add a Website to WAF <waf_01_0250>`.
