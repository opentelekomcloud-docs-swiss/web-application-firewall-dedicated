WAF and Other Services
======================

This topic describes WAF and other cloud services.

ELB
---

You can add your WAF instances to a load balancer so that your website traffic is distributed by the load balancer across WAF instances for detection and then forwarded by WAF to the origin server. In this way, website traffic will be protected even if one of your WAF instances becomes faulty.

IAM
---

Identity and Access Management (IAM) provides the permission management function for WAF. Only users granted WAF Administrator permissions can use WAF. To obtain this permission, contact the users who have the Security Administrator permissions.
